# python-project-part0

## Introduction

The goal of project part0 is to give you a brief introduction to *Git* and *GitHub*,  which we will use during the whole project.

## Getting Started

### What is Git and GitHub?

Skim through `basics.md` and learn about the concepts.

Another reference about git is [this](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

### Installing Git

See https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git. Get git installed on your system. 

### Git Basics

Follow the instructions of section2, **Git Basics** of [this link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2), learn how to get a git repository and make changes locally / in remote.

Do your own experiments, you probably will master these commands:

*git add* , *git commit* , *git log* , *git pull* , *git push* ...

### Git Branching

Follow the instructions of section3, **Git Branching** of [this link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2), learn how to branch out of the initial branch and merge branches.

After that, you probably will master:

*git branch* , *git checkout*, *git merge* ... and maybe more ways to use *git log*. 

There are also a [list of short videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLg7s6cbtAD15G8lNyoaYDuKZSKyJrgwB-) to help you get a better picture of git and github.

Basically, these are all you need during the project. But there are still many more features of github, like [issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues), that you could make use of. Explore [them](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/git-and-github-learning-resources) by yourself! 

## Exercise

There is a small exercise for you. Please check that if you can do these simple operations in the part0 repo.

1. Clone this part0 repo.
2. One member of the team creates an empty txt file, then it commit locally.
3. The team member pushes it to the remote.
4. The other two members fetch the commit to their local repo.
5. Three members make their own branches and do some modification to the file respectively.
6. Merge the three branch to the initial branch in the way you like.

The real part of the project is comming soon. Check out piazza very often and stay tuned!
